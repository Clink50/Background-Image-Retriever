# Background-Image-Retriever

## Description

### This is just a very simple script that I made in like 10 minutes. I was looking at the background images that I get on Windows 10 and I'm always wishing I could find images like that. I did a quick google on where these images are located and come to find out that the images are pulled from the internet and saved on my machine. So I decided to get those images before they are deleted by Windows by setting up a task and scheduled it to run every morning at 6 AM to save to a folder in my Pictures. It works like a charm and is pretty simple.

## Improvements

### One improvement that I would like to make that I have no clue how to do is that the images are mixed between Desktop and Mobile. Anything over 150KB is an image that I want to save in my folder. I don't know how to ignore the Mobile images and keep the Desktop images. So I still have a manual piece of going in and moving the mobile pictures to another folder by having to look at each individual picture and seeing that it has the dimensions for a mobile phone, but I thought what I have is good enough. So I hope you enjoy!

## Why?

### I'm new to python and have been wanting to learn it for a while, but I just haven't had a chance and just wanted to take this as an opportunity to learn a little bit and have a nice slideshow of backgrounds when I open my computer.
